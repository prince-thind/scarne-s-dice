# Scarne's Dice

This project is a recreation of the game - Scarne's Dice in vanilla JS. The game can be summarised as follows:

1. The game is a turn based two players game.
2. At any time, only one player can have the dice and roll it.
3. Before rolling the dice at any stage, the player has the chance to pass the dice to the other player.
4. When a dice rolls, the number on the dice is added to the player score except when the rolled number is 1.
5. The player continues to have the dice until the dice rolls a 1 or they choose to pass the dice willingly.
6. If the dice rolls 1, the player score turns 0 and they have to pass the dice to the other player.
7. The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game.
